ðŸ‘‰[The app is live here](https://travel-memory-game.netlify.app) ðŸ‘ˆ 

The **Travel Memory Game** is a front-end web application developed on April 29th/30th during a 24h remote hackathon at the [Wild Code School](https://www.wildcodeschool.com/en-GB). The topic was: travelling from the couch.

## The project

The projet was part of a web developement training program at the [Wild Code School](https://www.wildcodeschool.com/en-GB) during a 24h remote hackathon (April 2020). 

We decided to design a game that a user in lockdown would play in order to travel through webcam videos of a country of his choice. 

In order to play, you first need to select a country and a category. Then, based on these two criteria, a memory game session will be generated. The objective is to find the 8 matching cards to win an access to the webcam of the chosen country.

Developing a game has been a good way to materialize what we had been learning during the first one and half months of the program. We managed to consolidate our skills in React.js, to manipulate data using an API and learn how to use the React.js State Hooks. This hackathon has been an even more challenging project as we needed to work remotely.
 
## Features

* Choice between multiple countries
* Choice between 6 images categories
* Game session to try and find the 8 matching pairs
* Access to the webcams of the choosen country at the end of the game session

## Technologies

* React.js (State Hooks)
* JavaScript
* HTML5
* CSS3

## Hosting

* Netlify 

## API used

* [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/): we got from the api the images to be displayed in the game session based on 2 parameters: the country and the category (beach, nature, etc.)
* [Windy](https://api.windy.com/webcams/docs): we got an access to a repository of webcams based on the country selected by the user.
